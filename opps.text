1. What is meant by the term OOPs?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and methods.
 An object is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. 
 OOP promotes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build modular 
 and reusable code.



 2. What is the need for OOPs?
OOPs is essential because:

It models real-world entities, making problem-solving intuitive.
Encourages code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.
Enhances code maintainability and debugging by modularizing programs.
Provides better security with encapsulation and abstraction.
Improves collaboration in team-based projects by defining clear object roles.
